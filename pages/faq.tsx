            How does Bard work?
          </h2>

          <p>
            Bard is a writing platform where readers have the power to support the writers they love. Anyone can write on Bard and build a supporting audience. Readers can donate when they find content they love to support writers. We&apos;ve removed the influence of ads, bias of curation, and temptation to clickbait.
